    * [Jing] Continue work on user account features/functions
        * Registration may be buggy (saying that username already exists when
          it doesn't, double checked with databse).
        * Authentication code is displayed after account creation (e.g. user
          can see the auth code without checking their email)
        * Auth code submission, login processing, change password needs work
        
        LEFT OFF: debugging and continuing work on user account features,
        currently working on "registration_processing.php"
