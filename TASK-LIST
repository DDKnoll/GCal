    * [Jing] Continue work on user account features/functions
        * Registration may be buggy (saying that username already exists when
          it doesn't, double checked with databse).
        * Authentication code is displayed after account creation (e.g. user
          can see the auth code without checking their email)
        * Auth code submission, login processing, change password needs work
        
        LEFT OFF: debugging and continuing work on user account features,
        currently working on "registration_processing.php"

11/23
    * [Terian/Jing] Continued working on user account features/functions
        * Incorporated user registration, and confirmation into existing style
        * Debugged user registration and confirmation
            * Passwords entered into databse is now MD5 hashed
            * No more conflicting existing users
            * Confirmation code generated is 10 digits long
            * Confirmation changes 'confirmed' column in database to NULL
    * [Terian/Jing] Sidebar tag cloud now works
        * Added another get IDs function for tags
        * Tags use result page to display events with tag
    * [Andy] Created php script to generate RSS feed
        * We can write a wrapper script to apply this script to create RSS by:
            * category
            * most recently added
            * popularity
    * [Andy] Added a column to events table
        * dateAdded
        * Consider possibility of adding link column for each event (discuss?)
    ! [Jing] IMPORTANT UPDATE
        
        * Added global variable $_DIR to "global.php" to hold string containing
          the URL path to where GCal is currently being deployed.  YOU NEED TO 
          MODIFY THIS.
          
          This will allow users to change it so that everything is no longer 
          hard linked to my (Jing's) directory.  E.g. by changing $_DIR from 
          '/~liujingt/GCal/' to '/~rebelsky/GCal/' all links, redirects, and 
          calls will be to Sam's deployment of GCal in his directory.
